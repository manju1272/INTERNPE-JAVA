This repository contains all the Java tasks completed as part of my internship with InternPe.

📝 Overview
Throughout this internship, I worked on diverse Java-based programs that strengthened my problem-solving and logical thinking skills. The tasks ranged from simple control flow applications to pattern generation, array manipulation, and object-oriented programs. Each file reflects an individual concept that helped me better understand the practical use of Java.

💡 What I Learned
Applied core concepts like loops, arrays, and conditionals

Practiced debugging and input/output handling using BufferedReader and Scanner

Understood object-oriented features like classes, objects, and methods

Explored creativity through pattern-based and interactive programs

Enhanced my ability to write clean, readable, and functional code

📁 Contents
Logic-based challenges

Pattern and shape generators

Array utilities

Mini console-based games and applications

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
